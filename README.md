# Dengue-Prediction

Objective
<p>Dengue fever has emerged as one of the most serious diseases in recent years. There is some evidence that this disease is linked to climate change. If we can model the number of cases reported historically in a location using climate data for that location over the same time period, we will be able to anticipate the spread of this disease more accurately. As a result, we will be better equipped not just at the individual level, but also at the government level, for prevention and treatment initiatives.</p>
